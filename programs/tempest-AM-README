Description
===========

It is a well known fact that electrical devices and, in this case, 
specifically computers generate electromagnetic radiation which causes 
the device to interfere with radio reception, but also leak possibly 
sensitive information being processed. Tempest is a code word for US 
government programme aimed at attacking the radiation problem. However,
nowadays Tempest word is casually replaced with word EMSEC which stands
for Emission Security.

The electromagnetic radiation can be picked up from a distance with
special equipment. However, it has been showed that you don't need to have
expensive equipment to pick up the signal. Simple handheld radio with
some-what good antenna can do the job for you. It is also shown that with
modified black-and-white TV-set you can receive the image on your monitor
from a distance. This sort of equipment is not expensive and thus can be
easily used by eavesdropper.

Tempest-AM generates AM radio signal on your monitor in the form of
patterns. This pattern causes high resolution monitors to transmit the AM
signal. This signal can be picked up by simple handheld radio. Resolutions
above 1024x768 are high enough to do the job. Tempest-AM was tested on
resolution of 1152x864 and it worked fine. Tempest-AM can be set to
transmit any tone (any tone that human ear can hear) on any carrier.
However, there are some limits, currently it cannot transmit on FM but
that might change in the future (read TODO -file). Tempest-AM was tested 
on 7 Mhz to 22 Mhz. The real range is from 3 - 30 Mhz and it may be
possible to go even further. 

Tempest-AM is not a useful utility but merely an example for anyone who is
interested in Tempest and is able to test the program. However, there are
possible applications that someone could create. The paper by Kuhn and
Anderson describe a few applications but I only mention that modified
Tempest-AM program could be used to transmit data. Two distinct tones on
same carrier could be seen as bits 0 and 1. One could transmit data showing
these distinct patterns on high resolution monitor. The signal could then
be picked up by, say, simple handheld radio recorder and processed
properly to retrieve the original sent data. How the recieved signal can
be processed to get the original data is not very hard to do. However,
I'll leave this as an exercise for the people interested to test it.

I also must note that transmitting radio signal and possibly interfering
reception of public radio channels, may be and most certainly is illegal.
However, testing this program will not interfere any radio channels since
the signal cannot travel very far, or it can, but at least it cannot be 
picked up from great distance without special equipment. And, you cannot 
transmit on FM anyway, so this should not be a problem. But still, select 
a frequency that is not used if you'll test the program. And don't go to
the frequencies that are used by, say, police, fireworkers etc.

This package includes SVGA lib and X11 versions of the Tempest-AM. I've
tested both programs succesfully on high resolutions. I may add a frame
buffer version of the program later, it should be relatively fast and
have high resolutions and thus be a good choice to test the program.


Compiling and installing
========================

To compile the both SVGA library version and X11 version give commands,

	./configure
	make

This compiles the following programs:

	tempest_am_X11
	tempest_am_svga


Running the program
===================

Running Tempest-AM is very simple. However, you need to provide some 
information for the program before you can succesfully test the program.

Command line options:

-r <clock>	Resolution clock rate (from XF86Config)
-h <htotal>	Resolution horizontal total timing (from XF86Config)
-v <vtotal>	Resolution vertical total timing (from XF86Config)
-t <tone>	Tone frequency to be broadcasted (Hz)
-c <carrier>	Carrier frequency (Hz)
-s <w h>	Window size (eg. 1152 864) (default: 1024x768)
-q		Use square waves
-p		Generate PGM picture of the signal
-V		Displays help and version

and one additional option on SVGA lib version of the program:

-n <resolution>	SVGA library resolution number


Example:

Get your current resolution information from your XF86Config. I use
here my own settings as an example.

Modeline "1152x864"	135 
			1152 1464 1592 1776
			864 864 876 908

Information for the options are (man XF86Config for more info):

<clock> = 135
<htotal> = 1776
<vtotal> = 908

I select 1000 Hz as tone and 12 MHz as carrier. And I want it to
fill the entire screen:

./tempest_am_X11 -r 135 -h 1776 -v 908 -t 1000 -c 12000000 -s 1152 864

This causes my monitor to transmit 1000 Hz tone on 12 Mhz. The entire 
screen (resolution is 1152x864) is filled with the pattern. The screen
don't have to be as large as the resolution is but the fact is that the
signal is stronger when larger area of the screen is filled.

If you want to save the signal into a picture file then use -p option
and direct the output to a file. The program generates PGM picture which
generally can be viewed with any picture viewer; xv, kview, etc.


Using Tempest-AM
================

This section briefly covers how to test the program. You, of course, need
a proper radio receiver to test it. Probably the best choice is a cheap
handheld radio. The downside is that it probably has a very poor antenna
so you probably cannot receive the signal very afar from the monitor. But 
still, it can be used to test the program. You also need a high resolution 
monitor. If your video card and monitor can do resolution of 1024x768 and
above, you should be fine. I told you before that 1024x768 is a minimum 
but you certainly can try it on, say, 800x600, it just might work!

I succesfully tested the program in the same room where the monitor was
and all nearby rooms when I was near power lines (inside wall). As expected
the signal was strongest when I was very near the monitor and near power
lines. However, I had very poor antenna so with better antenna and maybe 
with band-pass filter, the  signal would've been heard a lot farer away. 
To test the program select the carrier frequency that should broadcast 
the tone and you should hear it. If your carrier is 12 Mhz the tone 
should be found very near that. I switched the frequency between 800 Hz 
and 1100 Hz so I could be certain that I found the right carrier. The 
tone is like a beeeeep sound so it is easy to recognize. And, when you 
terminate the program the beep sound should stop. This should give you 
enough certainty that you've found the right carrier. 

After this you can step away from the monitor and see how afar your can
hear the tone. You can move around the antenna near power lines and put it
parallel with power lines inside the wall. Move around and try from nearby
rooms as well. You probably hear a lot noise on the background thus the 
signal can be very weak. This is because of bad signal/noise ratio (SNR). 
With band-pass filter you could filter the noise away and thus get a lot
better SNR.

Tempest-AM can use sine waves and square waves in the signal. By default 
the program uses sine waves but generally square waves has a bit more 
energy in them so it might be a good idea to use square waves when testing 
the program.

For the people who is familiar with playing music could test a couple 
of special frequencies; C2 is = 523 Hz, C3 = 1047 Hz, C4 = 2094. It easy
to create other notes as well. I'll give you here a short list of 
frequencies for one octave (lowest notes on piano): 

	note	frequency (Hz)
	A0	110
	A#0	117
	B0	123
	C0	131
	C#0	139
	D0	147
	D#0	156
	E0	165
	F0	175
	F#	185
	G0	196
	G#0	208

There is a pattern in this: If you want for example A1 just double the A0
and you'll get A1, respectively. If you'll want D(-1) just divide D0 to 
get D(-1), respectively. And now to create playing monitor... :)


More information on Tempest
===========================

Tempest and electromagnetic radiation is an interesting topic. There
aren't very much public literature on this topic. Luckily, there are a
few technical papers and web sites on the net that are a must read.

Bugs
====

One big bug is that the X11 version of the program is painfully slow. I'll
try to find faster routines later. However, you don't need to draw the
pattern on the screen real time, you can use -p option and direct the output
to a file and use that.

There can be other bugs as well, I hope there isn't any in the calculation
of the signal though. If you'll find a bug then please report it.


Other Programs Using Tempest AM
===============================

I am aware of at least one program that uses the routines of the Tempest
AM called Tempest for Eliza, which creator took my joke seriosly about
creating playing monitor and made it happen. The Tempest for Eliza is
available from: http://www.erikyyy.de/tempest/.  Any questions about
this program should be sent to the author, not me.


Acknowledgements
================

I had a trouble testing the program at one time and Markus Kuhn (the author
of the reference paper) was kind enough set me straight on that. He was
even more kinder when he sent his own program he used in testings for the 
paper. Thank you! :)


Feedback and comments
=====================

You can send me feedback, comments and bug reports regarding this program.
I would like to hear if you succesfully tested the program.
