Ledman - Led device Manager
===========================

NOTE: This is alpha version of the manager. It handles the devices but
user interface is still missing. This is for testing only until I can
release version with full features.


Compiling:
==========

./make


Running:
========

Running this manager requires root privileges or SUID flag. However,
I do not recommend to set the SUID flag. 

./ledman
